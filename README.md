<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Hi there, I'm Zakir ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a computer science student at Ryerson University. I enjoy working in a variety of fields, even if they're not cs-based. My interests currently lie in Software Development, Data Analysis and Software Engineering. Though you will find a lot of my work here, you can find out more about me through my <a href="https://zakirdawood.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">portfolio website</a>.</p>
