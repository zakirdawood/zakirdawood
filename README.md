<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>As the Winter semester has started up again, my main focus shifts to my academic commitments again. In my spare time, I'm working with my friend on creating a site to help high school students with their university applications. Once the site is completed and/or hosted, the repository will be available.</p>
<p>On a more fun note, I'm always watching a tonne of shows (current completion count at about 30). I'm currently on season 6 of Suits. Hmu if you have any interesting shows!</p>
